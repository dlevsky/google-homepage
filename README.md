I am currently working on The Odin Project's Web Development 101 course. This is the final project in the chapter 'The Front End.'

In this webpage you will find a demonstration of the skills I have acquired for this chapter:
1- Two ways to move a div around on the page
2- Sticking a div onto the bottom or top of the page
3- Identifying the background color of an existing webpage
Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
4- Centering an element horizontally
5- Identifying three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
6- Understanding how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
7- Building a very basic form

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)

P.S. I also included a fun little surprise with the Google logo... or should I say, goog logo.
